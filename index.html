	<h1>Our Family Dog</h1>
	
	<br>

	<p>My favorite animal is our family dog, Taco. She is a 3 year old mixed breed. The best thing about her is her love for people. </p>
	<br>
	<p>Since Taco is a small dog (about 30 lbs) she is immediately territorial about her personal space when meeting other dogs for the first time. She will snap at them even if the other dog is friendly</p>
